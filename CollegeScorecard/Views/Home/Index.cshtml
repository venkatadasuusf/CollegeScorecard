<h2>College Scorecard Application</h2>
<hr />

<div>
    <p>
        This application let's you fetch college scorecard data from DATA.GOV Department of Education via their public <a href="https://api.data.gov/docs/ed/">API</a>.
        The College Scorecard is designed to increase transparency, putting the power in the hands of the public — from those choosing colleges to those improving college quality — to see how well different schools are serving their students.
        <br />
        <br />
        The <a asp-area="" asp-controller="Home" asp-action="CollegesList">Colleges List</a> tab fetches schools data from the
            <a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/documentation/">College Scorecard Data API </a> and displays the results.
        This data can also be saved in the local database.
        <br />
        The <a asp-area="" asp-controller="Home" asp-action="CollegeScorecard">College Scorecard</a> tab let's you select a College and fetches the scorecard details from local database.
           
        <br />
        The <a asp-area="" asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Refresh">Refresh</a> tab let's you refresh the local database, that is, remove all its contents.
